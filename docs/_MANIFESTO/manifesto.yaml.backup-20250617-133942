# MANIFESTO ENGINE 2.0 - VISION-ALIGNED ORCHESTRATION

prd_id: "PRD-2025-MAN-ENG"
title: "Manifesto Engine - Speed of Thought Orchestration"
status: "Draft"
owner: "Dale Carman"
vision: "Creative at the speed of thought - from vision to verified execution"

problem_statement: |
  AI agents forget the mission and veer off course. They claim tasks are done 
  when they aren't. There's no persistent alignment between vision and execution.
  
  We need a system that:
  1. Captures vision quickly (speed of thought)
  2. Breaks it into atomic, verifiable tasks
  3. Keeps agents aligned to the original vision
  4. Catches drift before it happens

metrics:
  north_star: "Time from idea to verified implementation"
  guardrails:
    - name: "Task creation time"
      target: "< 30 seconds"
      measurement: "Time to add new task via CLI"
    - name: "Vision drift"
      target: "0%"
      measurement: "Tasks rejected by supervisor for being off-mission"
    - name: "False completion rate"
      target: "0%"
      measurement: "Tasks that pass verification but don't meet intent"

core_innovations:
  1_persistent_vision:
    description: "Vision statement that ALL agents read before EVERY task"
    implementation: "Vision embedded in every prompt, verified by supervisor"
  
  2_task_hierarchy:
    description: "Vision → Epics → Tasks → Atomic Steps"

    commands:

      - "manifesto brain-dump fix-build-errors.md --parse"
      - "manifesto dictate --epic VISION-PRO"  # Voice input?

workflow_pattern: |
  1. VISIONARY (you) → shares vision/problem
  2. ARCHITECT (Claude/O3) → creates plan, breaks into epics
  3. SUPERVISOR → monitors alignment, prevents drift  
  4. WORKERS (Claude Code) → execute atomic tasks
  5. VERIFIER → cryptographic proof of completion

# TASKS - Building Manifesto Engine 2.0

tasks:
  - id: "TASK-001"
    title: "Refactor tasks to individual files"
    description: |
      Move from monolithic manifesto.yaml to:
      - manifesto.yaml (PRD + vision)
      - tasks/TASK-XXX.yaml (individual tasks)
      - epics/EPIC-XXX/README.md (epic vision)
    acceptance:
      migration_complete: "All existing tasks in separate files"
      backward_compatible: "Old format still loads"
      
  - id: "TASK-002"  
    title: "Speed-of-thought task creation"
    description: |
      Create 'manifesto add' command that:
      - Accepts free-form text
      - Parses into structured task
      - Links to active epic
      - < 30 seconds end-to-end
    acceptance:
      command_exists: "manifesto add --help"
      time_to_create: "< 30 seconds"
      
  - id: "TASK-003"
    title: "Vision alignment system"
    description: |
      Every task/epic must link to vision
      Supervisor checks alignment before execution
