# MANIFESTO ENGINE 2.0 - VISION-ALIGNED ORCHESTRATION

prd_id: PRD-2025-MAN-ENG
title: Manifesto Engine - Speed of Thought Orchestration
status: Draft
owner: Dale Carman
vision: Creative at the speed of thought - from vision to verified execution
problem_statement: "AI agents forget the mission and veer off course. They claim tasks\
  \ are done \nwhen they aren't. There's no persistent alignment between vision and\
  \ execution.\n\nWe need a system that:\n1. Captures vision quickly (speed of thought)\n\
  2. Breaks it into atomic, verifiable tasks\n3. Keeps agents aligned to the original\
  \ vision\n4. Catches drift before it happens\n"
metrics:
  north_star: Time from idea to verified implementation
  guardrails:
  - name: Task creation time
    target: < 30 seconds
    measurement: Time to add new task via CLI
  - name: Vision drift
    target: 0%
    measurement: Tasks rejected by supervisor for being off-mission
  - name: False completion rate
    target: 0%
    measurement: Tasks that pass verification but don't meet intent
core_innovations:
  1_persistent_vision:
    description: Vision statement that ALL agents read before EVERY task
    implementation: Vision embedded in every prompt, verified by supervisor
  2_task_hierarchy:
    description: Vision → Epics → Tasks → Atomic Steps
    implementation: 'vision.md          # Your high-level vision

      ├── EPIC-001/      # Major features

      │   ├── README.md  # Epic''s purpose & success criteria

      │   ├── TASK-001.yaml

      │   └── TASK-002.yaml

      '
  3_speed_of_thought_cli:
    description: Add tasks as fast as you can think
    commands:
    - manifesto add 'Fix all build errors' --epic BUILD
    - manifesto brain-dump fix-build-errors.md --parse
    - manifesto dictate --epic VISION-PRO
workflow_pattern: "1. VISIONARY (you) → shares vision/problem\n2. ARCHITECT (Claude/O3)\
  \ → creates plan, breaks into epics\n3. SUPERVISOR → monitors alignment, prevents\
  \ drift  \n4. WORKERS (Claude Code) → execute atomic tasks\n5. VERIFIER → cryptographic\
  \ proof of completion\n"
