## ðŸŽ‰ SUPERVISOR: TASK-002 COMPLETE!

Brilliant execution! The speed-of-thought interface is live. Let's test it with a real example:

## ðŸš€ Live Test - Create a Real Task

```bash
# Test with your actual Honda build example
manifesto add "Fix Honda build errors by capturing all errors then fixing top 5 symbols"

# Or try another example
manifesto add "Create supervisor prompt templates that prevent vision drift"
```

## âœ… Success Metrics Check

- [x] Command exists: `manifesto add --help` âœ“
- [x] Natural language parsing âœ“  
- [x] Auto ID generation (TASK-005) âœ“
- [x] Interactive clarification âœ“
- [x] < 30 second creation âœ“

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT: TASK-003 - Vision Alignment System

This is the KEY to preventing drift. Here's the prompt for Claude Code:

```markdown
ROLE: You are implementing TASK-003 "Vision alignment system"

CONTEXT:
- We can now quickly create tasks (TASK-002 complete)
- Problem: Agents forget the original vision and drift off course
- Solution: Every task must link to vision, supervisor checks alignment

OBJECTIVE: Create vision alignment system

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Every task MUST have 'vision_link' field
2. Create supervisor prompt template that includes vision
3. Add drift detection to task creation
4. Validation that rejects off-mission tasks

PLAN PHASE:
1. Update task schema to require vision_link
2. Create src/manifesto/templates/supervisor_prompt.md with:
   - Vision context injection
   - Task alignment checklist
   - Drift detection rules
3. Update task_parser.py to:
   - Ask "How does this align with vision?" during creation
   - Suggest vision links based on keywords
4. Create manifesto check-alignment command:
   - Reviews all tasks for vision drift
   - Flags tasks without clear connection
5. Show implementation approach

Example supervisor prompt structure:
```
ROLE: You are the SUPERVISOR ensuring vision alignment

VISION: {load from manifesto.yaml}

TASK TO REVIEW: {current task}

ALIGNMENT CHECKLIST:
â–¡ Does this task directly support the vision?
â–¡ Is the connection to vision clear in description?
â–¡ Will completing this get us closer to the goal?

If NO to any â†’ Request clarification
```

When I say "EXECUTE", implement the vision alignment system.
```

## ðŸ¤” Strategic Question

Before we proceed, let's create our first "real" task using your new speed interface. What's the most pressing task for the manifesto-engine itself?

Options:
1. "Create GitHub integration for automatic task tracking"
2. "Build supervisor templates that prevent drift"  
3. "Add markdown import for brain dumps"
4. "Create dashboard showing task completion progress"

Try one with `manifesto add` to feel the flow, then we'll build TASK-003.
